# Fixed Fingerprinting Implementation

## What Was Wrong

### ❌ Old Approach (Broken):
1. Computed fingerprint WITHOUT normalization
2. Used DBSCAN on standardized (but not normalized) vectors
3. Compared **magnitudes** instead of **directions**
4. Result: Label flipping looks similar because magnitudes are close

### ✅ New Approach (Fixed):
1. Compute fingerprint AND normalize to unit vector
2. Use **cosine similarity** (dot product of normalized vectors)
3. Compare **directions** not magnitudes
4. Result: Label flipping detected because directions are opposite!

## Key Changes

### 1. Normalization Added
```python
# OLD (wrong):
fingerprint = self.projection_matrix @ flat_update
return fingerprint.numpy()

# NEW (correct):
f_raw = self.projection_matrix @ flat_update
f_norm = torch.norm(f_raw)
fingerprint = f_raw / f_norm  # Normalize to unit vector
return fingerprint.numpy()
```

**Why:** Removes magnitude information, keeps only direction. Label flipping has similar magnitude but **opposite direction**.

### 2. Cosine Similarity Instead of DBSCAN
```python
# OLD (wrong):
scaler = StandardScaler()
fingerprints_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(fingerprints)
clustering = DBSCAN(eps=0.8, min_samples=2).fit(fingerprints_scaled)

# NEW (correct):
similarity_matrix = fingerprints @ fingerprints.T  # Dot product = cosine similarity
# For each client, count similar neighbors (similarity > 0.7)
densities = [np.sum(similarity_matrix[i] > 0.7) - 1 for i in range(n)]
# Main cluster = clients with many similar neighbors
```

**Why:** Cosine similarity directly measures directional alignment. Threshold 0.7 = angle < 45°.

### 3. Density-Based Main Cluster
```python
# Main cluster = clients with >= n/2 similar neighbors
main_cluster = [i for i, density in enumerate(densities) 
                if density >= n_clients // 2]
outliers = [i for i, density in enumerate(densities) 
            if density < n_clients // 2]
```

**Why:** Majority of clients are honest (Byzantine assumption). Honest clients point in similar direction → cluster together.

## How It Works Now

### Example: 5 Clients (2 Malicious)

**Step 1: Compute Normalized Fingerprints**
```
Client 0 [MALICIOUS]: f0 = [0.3, -0.5, 0.7, ...]  ||f0|| = 1
Client 1 [MALICIOUS]: f1 = [0.2, -0.6, 0.8, ...]  ||f1|| = 1
Client 2 [HONEST]:    f2 = [-0.4, 0.6, -0.2, ...] ||f2|| = 1
Client 3 [HONEST]:    f3 = [-0.3, 0.7, -0.3, ...] ||f3|| = 1
Client 4 [HONEST]:    f4 = [-0.5, 0.5, -0.1, ...] ||f4|| = 1
```

**Step 2: Compute Cosine Similarities**
```
Similarity Matrix:
         0     1     2     3     4
    0  1.00  0.95 -0.80 -0.75 -0.85  ← Malicious, opposite to honest
    1  0.95  1.00 -0.78 -0.82 -0.79  ← Malicious, opposite to honest
    2 -0.80 -0.78  1.00  0.92  0.88  ← Honest, similar to other honest
    3 -0.75 -0.82  0.92  1.00  0.90  ← Honest, similar to other honest
    4 -0.85 -0.79  0.88  0.90  1.00  ← Honest, similar to other honest
```

**Step 3: Count Neighbors (similarity > 0.7)**
```
Client 0: neighbors = [1] → density = 1
Client 1: neighbors = [0] → density = 1
Client 2: neighbors = [3, 4] → density = 2
Client 3: neighbors = [2, 4] → density = 2
Client 4: neighbors = [2, 3] → density = 2
```

**Step 4: Identify Main Cluster**
```
Threshold = 5 // 2 = 2 neighbors

Main cluster (density >= 2): [2, 3, 4] ✓ Honest clients!
Outliers (density < 2): [0, 1] ✓ Malicious clients!
```

**Step 5: Filtering Decision**
```
Clients 2, 3, 4: Auto-accept (skip validation)
Clients 0, 1: Validate on validation set → Reject (loss increases)
```

## Why This Fixes Label Flipping Detection

### Label Flipping Creates Opposite Directions

**Honest client (trains 3 → predicts 3):**
- Gradient pushes model to predict 3 when seeing digit 3
- Direction: towards correct classification

**Malicious client (trains 3 but label=6):**
- Gradient pushes model to predict 6 when seeing digit 3
- Direction: towards **wrong** classification (opposite!)

**Cosine similarity:** 
- Honest vs Honest: ~0.8-0.9 (similar direction)
- Malicious vs Honest: ~-0.7 to -0.9 (opposite direction!)
- Malicious vs Malicious: ~0.9 (both wrong in same way)

## Expected Results Now

### IID Data, Label Flipping (2/5 malicious):
```
[LAYER 1: FINGERPRINT CLUSTERING]
  Main cluster: [2, 3, 4] [3 clients] ← All honest
  Outliers: [0, 1] [2 clients] ← All malicious
  
[LAYER 2: VALIDATION FILTERING]
  Client 0: ✗ REJECT [validation] (Δloss=+0.15)
  Client 1: ✗ REJECT [validation] (Δloss=+0.12)
  Client 2: ✓ ACCEPT [fingerprint] (skipped validation)
  Client 3: ✓ ACCEPT [fingerprint] (skipped validation)
  Client 4: ✓ ACCEPT [fingerprint] (skipped validation)
```

**Detection Rate:** 100% (both malicious caught)
**False Positives:** 0% (no honest rejected)
**Speedup:** 2.5x (validate 2 instead of 5)

## Test It Now!

```bash
cd week4
python main.py
```

You should now see:
1. ✅ Fingerprints correctly identify outliers
2. ✅ Only outliers get validated (faster)
3. ✅ Malicious clients rejected
4. ✅ Accuracy recovers to ~85-90%

## Key Insight for Your Paper

**"Direction matters more than magnitude"**

- Fingerprinting with cosine similarity captures **semantic difference** between updates
- Label flipping doesn't just change magnitude, it **reverses direction**
- This is why it works even when magnitudes are similar!

This is a much stronger defense than just magnitude-based filtering.
