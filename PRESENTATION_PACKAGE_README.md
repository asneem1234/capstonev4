## Key Example: Weight Array Walkthrough

This is your **strongest visual aid**. Practice explaining it fluently:

```
"Let me show you a concrete example with actual numbers.

After local training, Client 0‚Äîthe malicious one‚Äîproduces an update 
with magnitude 2.45. It's trying to learn flipped labels, so weights 
move in the WRONG direction.

Clients 1 and 2, both honest, produce updates with magnitudes around 0.9. 
These are normal gradient descent steps.

We compute fingerprints using random projection: f = P √ó Œîw, then normalize.

When we compute cosine similarity, Clients 1 and 2 have similarity 0.94‚Äî
that's only 20 degrees apart. They cluster together.

Client 0 versus the others has NEGATIVE similarity‚Äîmore than 90 degrees. 
Completely different direction. Clear outlier.

We validate Client 0 on a held-out dataset. Global model has loss 0.52. 
With Client 0's update, loss jumps to 1.87. That's catastrophic!

Decision: REJECT Client 0. Aggregate only the honest updates.

Result: Model accuracy improves from 85% to 87%, despite 33% malicious clients."
```

**Practice this until you can do it without looking at notes!**
