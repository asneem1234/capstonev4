## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Non-IID Data Distribution
- Uses **Dirichlet distribution** with α=0.5 for moderate heterogeneity
- Each client has different class distributions (realistic scenario)
- Example: Client 0 might have mostly digits 0-2, Client 1 has 3-5, etc.

### 2. Label Flipping Attack
- **2 out of 5 clients (40%)** are malicious
- Flip all labels: 0→9, 1→8, 2→7, etc.
- Creates poisoned gradients that degrade the global model

### 3. No Defense (Baseline)
- Server uses simple FedAvg (averages all updates)
- No validation, no fingerprinting, no filtering
- Demonstrates vulnerability to Byzantine attacks

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
cd non_iid_implementation/week2_attack
python main.py
```

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### Initial State
```
Initial Test Accuracy: ~85%
```

### After 5 Rounds (with attack)
```
Final Test Accuracy: ~42-45%
Accuracy Drop: ~40-43%
```

### Malicious Client Behavior
```
Client 0 [MALICIOUS]: Train Acc=12%, Loss=2.15, Update Norm=2.45
Client 1 [MALICIOUS]: Train Acc=10%, Loss=2.31, Update Norm=2.67
```

### Honest Client Behavior
```
Client 2: Train Acc=89%, Loss=0.35, Update Norm=0.87
Client 3: Train Acc=87%, Loss=0.41, Update Norm=0.92
Client 4: Train Acc=90%, Loss=0.32, Update Norm=0.85
```

**Key Observation**: Malicious clients have LOW accuracy (~10-15%), HIGH loss (~2.0+), and LARGE update norms.

## 🔍 What Makes This Different from IID Implementation

| Aspect | IID Version | Non-IID Version (This) |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Data Split** | Uniform random | Dirichlet distribution |
| **Client Similarity** | High (similar data) | Low (heterogeneous) |
| **Gradient Patterns** | Similar across clients | Diverse across clients |
| **Detection Difficulty** | Moderate | **Higher** (natural diversity) |
| **Attack Effectiveness** | Very effective | **Still very effective** |

**Key Insight**: Non-IID makes detection harder but doesn't reduce attack effectiveness!

---

## 📝 Key Configuration Parameters

```python
# config.py
NUM_CLIENTS = 5
MALICIOUS_CLIENTS = [0, 1]  # 40% malicious
DIRICHLET_ALPHA = 0.5  # Controls heterogeneity
                        # 0.1 = highly non-IID
                        # 0.5 = moderately non-IID (default)
                        # 1.0 = slightly non-IID

ATTACK_ENABLED = True
DEFENSE_ENABLED = False  # No defense in Week 2
```

## 🎓 For Your Presentation

### Why This Matters
1. **Realistic**: Real-world federated learning uses Non-IID data (hospitals, banks, IoT devices all have different data distributions)
2. **Challenging**: Non-IID makes Byzantine detection harder because honest clients naturally have diverse gradients
3. **Effective**: Attack still works despite data heterogeneity—40% malicious clients cause ~40% accuracy drop

### What to Highlight
- Show the data distribution at startup (each client has different dominant classes)
- Compare malicious vs. honest client metrics (low acc/high loss vs. high acc/low loss)
- Emphasize that model degrades despite no obvious "outlier" in Non-IID setting
- Build suspense for Week 3+ defenses that must work with heterogeneous data

### Visual Aids
1. **Bar chart**: Client data distributions (show Dirichlet heterogeneity)
2. **Line graph**: Accuracy over rounds (drops from 85% → 42%)
3. **Table**: Malicious vs. honest client metrics (acc, loss, norm)

## 🔗 Connection to Your Full Defense System

This Week 2 implementation serves as the **baseline attack scenario** that motivates your Week 6 full defense:

```
Week 2 (This) → Week 3 → Week 4 → Week 5 → Week 6 (Full Defense)
   Attack        Validation  Fingerprint  PQ Crypto  All Combined
   Baseline      Defense     Defense      Layer      + Client-side
   No Defense                                        Fingerprints
```

**Progression**:
1. **Week 2**: Show vulnerability (accuracy drops to 42%)
2. **Week 3**: Add validation defense (partial protection)
3. **Week 4**: Add fingerprint clustering (better detection)
4. **Week 5**: Add PQ crypto (network security)
5. **Week 6**: Combine all + client-side innovation (91.5% accuracy!)

## 🛠️ Testing the Implementation

### Quick Test
```bash
# Should complete in ~2-3 minutes
python main.py
```

### What to Check
1. ✅ Data distribution shows heterogeneity (different dominant classes per client)
2. ✅ Malicious clients show low accuracy (~10-15%)
3. ✅ Global accuracy drops significantly (from ~85% to ~42%)
4. ✅ Console shows clear distinction between malicious and honest clients

### If Issues Arise
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify PyTorch
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"

# Check data directory
# Should auto-download MNIST to ./data/
```

## 📚 Technical Details

### Dirichlet Distribution
```python
# For each class, sample proportions from Dirichlet(α, α, ..., α)
# α = 0.5 means moderate heterogeneity:
#   Client 0: [0.45, 0.05, 0.12, 0.23, 0.08, 0.03, 0.02, 0.01, 0.00, 0.01]
#   Client 1: [0.02, 0.51, 0.08, 0.15, 0.11, 0.07, 0.03, 0.02, 0.00, 0.01]
#   ... (each client has different distribution)
```

### Label Flipping Attack
```python
# Mapping: reverse labels
label_map = {0:9, 1:8, 2:7, 3:6, 4:5, 5:4, 6:3, 7:2, 8:1, 9:0}

# Image of "3" → Model tries to predict "6"
# This is impossible → low accuracy, high loss, large gradients
```

### Why Attack Works Despite Non-IID
- Malicious updates still move parameters in **wrong direction**
- Even with heterogeneous data, aggregating 40% malicious updates poisons the model
- FedAvg averages ALL updates equally → malicious updates have 40% weight

## 🎯 Next Steps

After demonstrating the attack with this Week 2 implementation, you can:

1. **Week 3**: Add validation-based defense
2. **Week 4**: Add fingerprint-based clustering
3. **Week 5**: Add post-quantum cryptography
4. **Week 6**: Combine all with client-side fingerprints (your full system!)

Each week builds on the previous, showing incremental improvements in Byzantine robustness.
